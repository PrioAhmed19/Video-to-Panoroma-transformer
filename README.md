# Video-to-Panoroma-transformer
This is a simple project that converts a video into a panoramic image by stitching frames together using computer vision techniques. It extracts key frames, aligns them, and blends them seamlessly to generate a wide-view panorama. Ideal for generating panoramic images from drone footage, surveillance videos, or handheld camera recordings.
